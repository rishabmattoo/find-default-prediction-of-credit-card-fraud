# find-default-prediction-of-credit-card-fraud
This repository contains the code and resources for a data science project that utilizes K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

## Project Purpose

The project aims to develop a classification model to identify fraudulent transactions within a credit card dataset. This can help financial institutions reduce financial losses and enhance customer security.

## Problem Statement

Credit card fraud is a significant concern, with unauthorized use of cards leading to financial losses for both cardholders and issuing banks. This project addresses the challenge of building a model to effectively classify credit card transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project contains transactions made by credit cards cardholders. It is highly unbalanced, with a vast majority of legitimate transactions and a small number of fraudulent transactions. The dataset can be accessed from data folder.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

- Load the credit card transaction data from a CSV file.
- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Convert categorical features (if any) into numerical representations.
- Apply SMOTE to address class imbalance in the data (oversampling the minority class - fraudulent transactions).
- Standardize numerical features (optional).

### Model Selection and Training

- Implement a KNN classification model.
- Use GridSearchCV to tune the KNN hyperparameter (distance metric).
- Split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets.
- Train the KNN model on the training set.

### Model Evaluation

- Evaluate the trained model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and AUC-ROC (considering class imbalance).
- Analyze the results to assess the model's effectiveness in identifying fraudulent transactions.

### Model Deployment (Optional)

- Consider strategies for deploying the model in a production environment, addressing KNN's computational and memory demands (e.g., k-d trees, dimensionality reduction, cloud-based deployment).

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:
-pandas
-numpy
-sklearn (including KNN, GridSearchCV, SMOTE)
-matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

## Running the Project

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt (assuming a requirements.txt file is present with listed dependencies).
- Load the dataset from your specific location.
- Run the Jupyter notebook

## Further Considerations

- This is a basic implementation. Explore feature engineering techniques for potentially improved performance.
- Consider cost-sensitive learning to account for the financial impact of misclassifications.
- Evaluate the model on unseen data to assess real-world generalizability.
